# Get ThingSPIN help
------------------
First, check the official [ThingSPIN documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/).

If you require further help or support then ask a question in the [ThingSPIN community site](https://community.grafana.com/) or [ThingSPIN Slack](http://slack.raintank.io/). You can also search the community site for previously answered questions, in case someone already had your problem and got help.

 **Please note:**
- The ThingSPIN project uses GitHub mainly for tracking bugs and feature requests.
- Do not open an issue just to ask a question. The issue will be closed immediately.
- Only submit issues for bug reports, feature requests, or enhancements.
